### About 
**Get_Next_Line** is a project i made it during my student years at 1337 School khouribga (one of 42 network) and the aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor.

### Project Contents :

- [x] 01. Libft : C library regrouping usual functions that weâ€™ll be allowed to use in all your other projects.
- [x] 02. Get_Next_Line
- [x] 03. test files : You can use them on correction for testing the performance of gnl 

### Before you start coding GNL start with reading this :  

- **[All about EOF ](https://latedev.wordpress.com/2012/12/04/all-about-eof/)**  : that article can prove useful for someone who can read.
- **[Static variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_variable)** : good start to know Static variable
- **[File_descriptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor)** : What are file descriptors?

### How to realize GNL step by step 

(i will add this soon)
